GENOUT

GeoInklines:

when generating thickness map, check if Outline exists to assign


new tool:
Zero location one axis

Geometric Inklines addon:
Polishing before releasing. Still a few features missing, but most of it works ok (and the code is a mess too ;-)  ).
What do you think of the naming?

By now you can:
+ Generate automatic geometric inklines based in the Inverted Hull method using a pre-tuned Solidify modifier.
+ Generate bevel based inner lines (modifier too). Good for hardsurfaces mostly.
+ Generate an automatic vertex weight map to modulate the Outline thickness based on the vertex normals, by either:
  • Selecting just one object: the map is generated based on the vertical normal alone, thinner above, thicker below
  • Selecting one Sun Light and then an object after: the map is generated based on the light angle.
  • Selecting any other kind of light and then an object after: the map is generated using the relative position between object and light (thanks to Vitor Balbio for the math).
+ Adjust all these settings using a centralized panel.

The Outlines work even on beveled curves (thanks to the bugfix by Bastien Montagne). But these (alas!) aren't compatible with variable thickness yet due to a limitation of Blender.

There are a few caveats, i'll try to resolve all I can before releasing. 
I'll set up a Github so everyone inspired can contribute.

Thanks all for your feedback!
